# Frontend Mentor - Todo app

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to front-end coding challenge.


**This challenge reuired a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out a todo app and get it looking as close to the given design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

The designs were given in JPG static format. This meant that needed to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should helped train my eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.
